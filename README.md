### Bugs

There's a known bug on shortcut widget, all keystrokes are not recognized (at least on my Debian)
> If you can't define a shortcut from plugin's interface, then do it from Krita's shortcuts interface

The plugin use Krita's API `Krita.instance().resources()`: on my DEV computer, with ~1000 presets, first call to this API function need ~4.0s for execution
- With plugin installed, Krita's startup will need a little bit more time than usual
- Should be faster with less presets
> A [bug](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=473311) has been opened on Krita side for this case, not sure if it can be fixed or not...
